			<p>Why is This So Important?</p>
			<p>Quality Education is so important for our society because the children and students are our future and have the fate of the world in their hands. If these students do not receive the proper preparation society could be affected by their decisions.</p>
		</div>
		<div id = "question2">
			<p>What Happens If We Don't Do Something?</p>
			<p>If we don't do something now, or in the near future, our future society could be greatly effected because there are not enough experienced workers and students.</p>
		</div>
		<div id = "question3">
			<p>What Can You Do To Help?</p>	
			<p>One big thing you can do to help is donate to a charity. For example, Save the Children (linked below), or any other charity of your choice. Also, you can do your best to get involved in community service activities and protests to help the cause.</p>
